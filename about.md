# About Me

I am a PhD-qualified academic professional specializing in Commerce and Management. My interests include research, teaching, curriculum planning, student mentoring, and academic leadership.

I have actively contributed to institutional development through departmental leadership and cultural activities, while maintaining a strong research publication record in SCOPUS, UGC CARE, and ABDC-indexed journals.
